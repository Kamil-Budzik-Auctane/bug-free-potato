Backend Implementation Request: Risk Delivery Assessment API
Context
The frontend team has implemented a new Risk Delivery Assessment feature for the ShipStation application. This feature displays AI-powered delivery risk analysis for orders. The frontend is currently using mock data and needs a backend API endpoint to provide real risk assessment data.


Response Format
The API should return a JSON response with the following structure:

{
  "score": 75,                    // Overall risk score (0-100, where 100 = highest risk)
  "confidenceLevel": 92,          // AI model confidence percentage (0-100)
  "predictedDelayDays": 2,        // Number of days delay predicted (0 if no delay)
  
  "factors": {
    "carrierPerformance": {
      "score": 85,                // Individual factor risk score (0-100)
      "weight": 30,               // Percentage weight in overall calculation
      "status": "Poor performance history with this carrier",
      "level": "high"             // Risk level: "high" | "medium" | "low"
    },
    "routeDistance": {
      "score": 70,
      "weight": 25,
      "status": "Long distance route with multiple stops",
      "level": "medium"
    },
    "weather": {
      "score": 60,
      "weight": 25,
      "status": "Minor weather concerns along route",
      "level": "medium"
    },
    "currentDelays": {
      "score": 80,
      "weight": 20,
      "status": "Carrier experiencing network-wide delays",
      "level": "high"
    }
  },
  
  "originalDeliveryDate": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",    // ISO 8601 format
  "revisedDeliveryDate": "2024-01-17T00:00:00Z"      // Adjusted date if delay predicted
}

Business Logic Requirements
Risk Score Calculation
Overall risk score should be weighted average of all factors
Formula: (carrierPerformance.score * 0.30) + (routeDistance.score * 0.25) + (weather.score * 0.25) + (currentDelays.score * 0.20)
Risk Level Thresholds
High Risk: score >= 80
Medium Risk: score >= 50 && score < 80
Low Risk: score < 50
Factor Weights (must total 100%)
Carrier Performance: 30%
Route Distance/Complexity: 25%
Weather Conditions: 25%
Current Carrier Delays: 20%
Delay Prediction
High risk (80+): Predict 2-3 days delay
Medium risk (50-79): Predict 1-2 days delay
Low risk (<50): No delay predicted
Data Sources Needed
Carrier Performance: Historical on-time delivery rates, damage rates, customer complaints
Route Distance: Miles, number of stops, route complexity, urban vs rural
Weather: Current and forecasted conditions along route (integrate weather API)
Current Delays: Real-time carrier network status, port congestion, known issues
Additional Considerations
Cache risk assessments with 1-hour TTL to reduce computation
Consider webhook/WebSocket for real-time risk updates
Log all risk assessments for ML model training
Include request ID for debugging: X-Risk-Assessment-ID header
Error Responses
// 404 - Order not found
{
  "error": "ORDER_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "Order with ID {orderId} not found"
}

// 503 - Risk assessment unavailable
{
  "error": "RISK_ASSESSMENT_UNAVAILABLE", 
  "message": "Risk assessment service temporarily unavailable"
}

Performance Requirements
Response time: < 500ms (use caching)
Support concurrent requests for bulk order views
Graceful degradation if external services (weather API) fail
Please implement this endpoint to support the new Risk Delivery Assessment feature in the ShipStation frontend.

PLEASE CHECK WHAT FRONTEND NEEDS< let me know if something is too hard to implement, let me know if there is a better way to handling smth and so on. modify the xisting codebase to handle new requirements, business logic is fine, but the output we give might need to be modified
